# Exploratory Data Analysis - The Manufacturing Process

### This project showcases the power of exploratory data analysis, uncovering valuable insights from large datasets and shows how insights can be leveraged to drive business success.

The project uses classes to: extract data from the cloud, transform the data within the dataframe ,transform the dataframe a number of times, and provide information on the dataframe through statistical and visual methods. 

## Installation instructions:

 ## Things learned along the way:

 - Extracting data from a cloud location
 - Converting data types to more applicable forms
 - Creation of well-presented graphical representations, including overlaid graphs
 - Imputing missing and Null values
 - Correcting skew in data, and determining the correct method of doing so
 - Removing outliers based on different metrics such as z-score of IQR
 - Dropping columns based on correlation
 - Doing basid EDA techniques to leverage understanding of the data
